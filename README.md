## Split-brood experiment 1: photoperiod treatments at a constant temperature
### Script: ```2_scripts/1_EggPhotoExp2014_analysis.R```
R script to reproduce the analysis and visualization (incl. manuscript figures) of the 2014 winter moth egg photoperiod experiment: Does photoperiod received at the egg stage affect the seasonal timing of egg hatching?

## Split-brood experiment 2: photoperiod x temperature treatments
### Script: ```2_scripts/2_EggPhotoTempExp2001_analysis.R```
R script to reproduce the analysis and visualization (incl. manuscript figures) of the 2001 winter moth egg photoperiod-temperature experiment: What is the relative contribution of photoperiod and temperature on the timing of egg hatching?
